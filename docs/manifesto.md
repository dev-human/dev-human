# dev-human principles

1. You are not a developer who happens to be human, you are a human who happens to be a developer. We all share this and, as such, we can't neglect our personal evolvement, in favor of our technical skills. Programming is deeply integrated into our lifes, but it cannot represent alone what you **are**. 

2. Programming requires much more than technical knowledge - it requires patience, creativity, curiosity, among other things that cannot be mimicked by a "robot". By improving the human being, you improve the developer.

3. We are still learning how to deal with the Internet and the huge amount of information we are exposed every day. There's not many people, and even less developers, thinking about the implications this overflow can cause to us. We are responsible for what the web is going to be in the future. We should talk about this and other non-technical subjects that will help building better developers.

4. As a community, we are stronger. We share the jargons, the ups and downs of being a developer; we have similar problems, we have similar stories, but everyone has something to add. And when we put all the pieces together, we see the big picture of community.


# the dev-human project

A collaborative digital magazine inspired by the hacktivism and the simple notion of "life hacking", for the developers community. A place to share and discuss ideas in some way related to IT, but not technical in nature.
