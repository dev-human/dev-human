Hi there!

**dev-human** is a project I've been mentally nurturing for about one year now. A couple friends heard me talking about it.
But I could never bring it into reality, until now.

After raving with complex development ideas that would take forever to implement, I just found out that the most important thing
about this project is not code, or anything programming-related. The most important matter for building _dev-human_
is **content**. And **people** able to create this content.

So today I'm releasing dev-human 's bootstrap. It took me 2 days to build this base using [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/), a static website generator
from the great [Beau Simensen](https://twitter.com/beausimensen). I like things simple, and I like to focus on content instead of code, from time to time.

Please have a look at our [about page](/about) to better understand what is **dev-human**.

I hope some of you will join me, contributing with your ideas - this is not the kind of project that can be built with one mind only.
Do you have an interesting idea to share? A story? A theory? A hobby? Something funny? Something that sounded too off-topic for your
technical blog? Then please, [contribute](/docs/contribute).
