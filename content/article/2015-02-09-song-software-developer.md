##### song of the software developer

dear faceless bro of mine  
i talk to you silently  
through the software  
that i write

i strive to reach silently  
to you through the  
code i write

at times i swim in one small box  
a pixel high a pixel wide  
and i am lost  
semi lost colon lost  
dark color coded screens  
breaks in code  
error screams

i forget

there is a human on that side  
my bro my user  
he gets lost  
from my mind  

UI UX they remind  
and i rewind  

why am i doing this?  

to be one  
with you faceless bro of mine  
to be one  
an interwoven world divine  
to be one  
with my own soul that shines
