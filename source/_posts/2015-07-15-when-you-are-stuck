Are you also a person who gets stuck a lot of time in coding? You have this good idea you want to work out and it seems to you 
fairly simple. You guestimate to finish it within a week, but when you start working on your little idea you find yourself getting stuck
on a technical issue before you know. This has happened to me a lot of times and still happends to me quite often.

That feeling of 'why can't i just finish this like any other programmer? ' Why is it taking me so long? I get this uncomfortable feeling and 
it actually makes me a little stressed out. So since this happend to me again last week I started thinking to myself:

  - How can I avoid getting stressed every time i run into trouble?
  - What options do I have to solve my problems.
