This post has much to do with the one made by [Erika Heidi](http://www.twitter.com/ericaheidi):  **[The Art of Programming](http://dev-human.com/entries/2014/12/19/the-art-of-programming/)**.

She states:

> Respect the work of others, even if you think there is something with a similar purpose already out there. It's their expression. They are not trying to reinvent the wheel. They are trying to create a better wheel, or a wheel that works better for their purposes.

And I agree with her. For instance, I worked in a company where people weren't much of a fan of `PSR-2` or any kind of code styling. Did I agree with that? NOPE, in the end I was able to convince them to standardize  some stuff. But they were working perfectly before I even enter the team, and as a teammate I tried to contribute, it was hard to convince them why `git` was better than `svn`  for our scenario and stuff like that.

But imagine the following, you have an idea, that you think it is awesome, and you think it can help someone else. It will be a pain in the ass to develop the idea, make it work, but you put yourself through that anyway. And let's imagine you did it. Awesome, right? Let's publish it!

And all of the sudden there are 23 PR's of people helping you to improve your code, adding more functionalities, but are also those 5% of people who are only there to criticize what you did and diminish your job.

And that kind of criticism isn't helpful at all. I've learned that if you don't have something useful to add, just keep your mouth shut. Because of those 5% of horrible people out there, I will call them the **_code-trolls_**, exists awesome people that choose not to contribute, they just to go to work, do a side project here and there and go on with their lives. They may even follow you on twitter.

They probably have done awesome code to their companies, but they can't share because is private, and that is ok, because not everyone is obligated to have a **Github** account or participate in the community. (I won't enter in the discussion that a Github account should be a person CV).

But because of the **_code-trolls_** people are afraid to do participate, and becoming a target of people tirades. I have been witness to that, and I can state you need to have thick skin to deal with the fire squad. I am not saying that sensible people can't participate. I think we are handling people in the wrong way. People make mistakes and making a big deal of if it only makes the person never want to do Open Source again.

Some may say that Open Source is a great school, which you can learn a lot. I believe that, but only if people are open to accept others into their groups, because I saw some projects around, and they are like [The Clubhouse fellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Lulu), not because of sexism, but because only participate in the Open Source project people that are their friends, or famous in a some way. So in other words, the project is open, the community isn't.

To summarize: being a **_code-troll_** drive people away and to make an Open Source project "V.I.P." doesn't help the community, only helps people's ego. And to me, this is a cause worth fighting for: **Let's be the host, not the bouncer**, because it takes a lot of courage to make yourself open like that.

I encourage you to read the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), it is code of conduct for open source projects, but reading isn't enough, we must remind each other to follow it.
